## What is a Blockchain?

We can use an analogy to understand how a blockchain works. Let's consider a bank.
Suppose that Alice wants to send money to Bob via a wire transfer. All of Alice's
money is stored inside a bank account, which has two primary purposes. It keeps
track of how much money she has and it provides an online portal that allows her to
perform the transfer to Bob. Behind the scenes, the bank has two primary technical
features that make this possible:
1. Database: The bank maintains a database ledger of all of Alice's transaction to
determine her account balance and transaction history.
2. Network: The bank uses a network to process wire transfers so that funds can be
transferred from her account's to Bob's account.

**Blockchain** presents an alternative to this model by eliminating the need for a bank
altogether. Instead of sending money to Bob via wire transfer, Alice can send him
cryptocurrency directly with a blockchain. Much like a bank, the Blockchain gives Alice
a place to safely store her funds and send money to Bob. It replaces the two primary
technical features of a bank; a *database*, as the blockchain also keeps track of how
much money Alice has and a *Network* as Alice can connect to a blockchain in order to
send money. Once she does so, the blockchain processes her transaction and moves the funds
from her account to Bob's. Because a blockchain serves both of these vital roles, we can think
of a blockchain as both a network and a database at the same time.

A Blockchain is a Peer-to-peer network, meaning it is a system of nodes or computers that all
talk to each another. It is responsible for processing transactions, so that Alice can send money
to Bob. Alice simply needs to connect to a node on the network in order to initiate the
transaction and the blockchain handles the rest behind-the-scenes.
Since a blockchain also functions as a database, each node on the network maintains a copy of
all the data on the blockchain. For e.g., every node knows how much money Alice has on her account.
Instead of a bank storing all that data in a central database, the blockchain stores it
redundantly on each node on the network. This makes it virtually impossible to tamper with the
data. For e.g., Alice can't manipulate her account balance because all of the other nodes knows
exactly how much money she really has.

It is important to note that *Blockchain* and *Cryptocurrency* are not the same thing. *Bitcoin* is
a cryptocurrency, but Blockchain is the underlying technology behind Bitcoin. Apart from Cryptos,
Blockchains can be used in various other scenarios.

## How does a Blockchain work?

Suppose Alice wants to send some Bitcoin to Bob. In order to do this, both of them need an
account on the Bitcoin blockchain. Their accounts are much like their usernames. Alice must
know Bob's username or account address in order to send the crypto to him. Next, Alice needs
a Bitcoin wallet in order to send the transaction. The transaction is a three step process;
First, Alice enters Bob's account address as the recipient, then she specifies the amount of
Bitcoin she wants to send. Finally, Alice *signs* the transaction in order to make it official.
In the last step, Alice signs the transaction with her *private key*. If the account address is like
a username, then the private key is like the password to the account. Private key is sensitive data
stored inside a Wallet that Alice shouldn't share with anybody. Alice's private key allows her to
create digital signatures that authorise her transactions on the Blockchain, like sending BTC to Bob.
That's all that Alice needs to do in order to send the crypto. The rest is processed behind the scenes on
the blockchain.
